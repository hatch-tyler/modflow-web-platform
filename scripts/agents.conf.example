# PEST++ Agent Deployment Configuration
# ======================================
#
# This file defines the remote machines where PEST++ agents will be deployed.
#
# Format: hostname_or_ip [username] [num_agents]
#
# - hostname_or_ip: IP address or hostname of the machine
# - username: SSH username (defaults to current user if not specified)
# - num_agents: Number of agent containers to run (defaults to 4)
#
# Prerequisites:
# - SSH key-based authentication must be set up (ssh-copy-id user@host)
# - Docker must be installed on all target machines
# - Target machines must be able to reach the main server on ports 4004 and 9000
#
# Tips for num_agents:
# - Use (CPU cores - 1) as a good starting point
# - For machines also doing other work, use fewer agents
# - WSL2 on Windows has some overhead, so use slightly fewer agents
#
